In this project, We will train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new handwritten digits after showing it pictures of many real handwritten digits from mnist dataset provided by Tensorflow.

Generative Adversarial Nets is that you have two networks, a generator G and a discriminator D, competing against each other.

The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks as close as possible to real, training data.

The discriminator is a classifier that is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake.

You can view the images generated by Generator on particular epochs in MnistImagesByGeneratorAppliedAI Folder.
